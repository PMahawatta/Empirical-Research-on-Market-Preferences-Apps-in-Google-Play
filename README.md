# Empirical-Research-on-Market-Preferences-Apps-in-Google-Play
The Google Play Store is a popular platform for mobile app distribution, with thousands of developers working to create successful apps. However, the revenue model for apps is unknown, and success is often determined by installs and user ratings rather than revenue generated. This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on Google Play Store data to identify relationships with specific features, such as app name length, and identify market preferences for successful apps.

 Objectives of The Project
 
• The main objective of this project is to deliver insights to understand customer 
demands better and thus help developers to popularize the product.

• The study's goal is to uncover market preferences by examining Google Play Store 
categories, ratings, reviews, price, size, and so on. 

• Determine what types of apps have the most downloads, ratings, and reviews, 
including paid and non-paid effects on the app's ratings and reviews. 

• Determining the impact of numerous app factors on Google Play app installation
